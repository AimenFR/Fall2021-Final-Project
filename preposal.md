# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm considering either a Discord bot, a PokeDex or a small side scrolling platformer. Or possibly a Discord bot that has a PokeDex in it. Lastly maybe a laser trip wire that sends me an email.  

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I currently do not plan to collaborte with anyone 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not really, aside from maybe what the difficulty level of what I've chosen is actual achievable, based on my performance in this class
