# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Magic Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Discord bot that does magic card/Math tricks 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I'll use the Discord platform and program my own bot that will have a few basic functions, such as saying hello, bye, providing a random number, taking in a user input and using that for magic tricks. When prompted it will do the magic tricks I've programmed into it. I'll create my own server and channel for the bot, and connect that to my Python, from there I'll code in the basic functions and then the more detailed ones, and then the bot should run the functions.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have the Dicsord bot set up, the server made, the channels created, as well as have Math magic tricks programmed into it most definitely, ideally around six to seven of them

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I believe I can have at least seven Math tricks and possibily three or four card tricks as well

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be around seven each of the card tricks

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to learn how to code a Discord bot and set it up, I'll have to study casino bots and apply that knowledge to what I wish to accomplish. I will have to study several magic tricks to see which ones are possible using the software, as many magic tricks require sleight of hand.
